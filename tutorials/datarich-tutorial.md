# Publish data-rich stories with DataHub Cloud

In this tutorial, we are going to cover the basics of creating and publishing data-rich documents.

## Steps

### Create a GitHub repo

First, create a repo under your organisation or user in GitHub. DataHub currently does not support private repos, so make sure this new repo is public.

### Push a `README.md` file to the repo

Now, let's start with creating a `README.md` file. In this file, feel free to use anything that markdown has to offer. For this tutorial, we are going to use the following basic structure:

```markdown
# Data-rich story

## Table

## Chart
```

### Add a table

Let's add a table to the `README.md` file. Under the `## Table` header in your file, add the following snippet:

```mdx
<FlatUiTable
  data={{
    values: [
      {
        age: 35,
        firstName: 'Jon',
        id: 1,
        lastName: 'Snow'
      },
      {
        age: 42,
        firstName: 'Cersei',
        id: 2,
        lastName: 'Lannister'
      },
      {
        age: 45,
        firstName: 'Jaime',
        id: 3,
        lastName: 'Lannister'
      },
      {
        age: 16,
        firstName: 'Arya',
        id: 4,
        lastName: 'Stark'
      },
      {
        age: 44,
        firstName: 'Ferrara',
        id: 7,
        lastName: 'Clifford'
      },
      {
        age: 36,
        firstName: 'Rossini',
        id: 8,
        lastName: 'Frances'
      },
      {
        age: 65,
        firstName: 'Harvey',
        id: 9,
        lastName: 'Roxie'
      }
    ]
  }}
 />
```

Here's what it's going to look like:

<FlatUiTable
  data={{
    values: [
      {
        age: 35,
        firstName: 'Jon',
        id: 1,
        lastName: 'Snow'
      },
      {
        age: 42,
        firstName: 'Cersei',
        id: 2,
        lastName: 'Lannister'
      },
      {
        age: 45,
        firstName: 'Jaime',
        id: 3,
        lastName: 'Lannister'
      },
      {
        age: 16,
        firstName: 'Arya',
        id: 4,
        lastName: 'Stark'
      },
      {
        age: 44,
        firstName: 'Ferrara',
        id: 7,
        lastName: 'Clifford'
      },
      {
        age: 36,
        firstName: 'Rossini',
        id: 8,
        lastName: 'Frances'
      },
      {
        age: 65,
        firstName: 'Harvey',
        id: 9,
        lastName: 'Roxie'
      }
    ]
  }}
 />
 
### Add a chart

Now, let's add a graph to the README file. To keep it simple, we are going to use the LineChart component in this tutorial. Add the following snippet to your README file under the `## Chart` header:

```mdx
<LineChart
  data={{
    values: [
      {
        value: -0.41765878,
        year: '1850'
      },
      {
        value: -0.2333498,
        year: '1851'
      },
      {
        value: -0.22939907,
        year: '1852'
      },
      {
        value: -0.27035445,
        year: '1853'
      },
      {
        value: -0.29163003,
        year: '1854'
      }
    ]
  }}
  xAxis="year"
  yAxis="value"
/>
```

This is what it will look like when rendered:

<LineChart
  data={{
    values: [
      {
        value: -0.41765878,
        year: '1850'
      },
      {
        value: -0.2333498,
        year: '1851'
      },
      {
        value: -0.22939907,
        year: '1852'
      },
      {
        value: -0.27035445,
        year: '1853'
      },
      {
        value: -0.29163003,
        year: '1854'
      }
    ]
  }}
  xAxis="year"
  yAxis="value"
/>

### Final document

At this point, your document should look like this:

```markdown
# Data-rich story

## Table

<FlatUiTable
  data={{
    values: [
      {
        age: 35,
        firstName: 'Jon',
        id: 1,
        lastName: 'Snow'
      },
      {
        age: 42,
        firstName: 'Cersei',
        id: 2,
        lastName: 'Lannister'
      },
      {
        age: 45,
        firstName: 'Jaime',
        id: 3,
        lastName: 'Lannister'
      },
      {
        age: 16,
        firstName: 'Arya',
        id: 4,
        lastName: 'Stark'
      },
      {
        age: 44,
        firstName: 'Ferrara',
        id: 7,
        lastName: 'Clifford'
      },
      {
        age: 36,
        firstName: 'Rossini',
        id: 8,
        lastName: 'Frances'
      },
      {
        age: 65,
        firstName: 'Harvey',
        id: 9,
        lastName: 'Roxie'
      }
    ]
  }}
 />

## Chart

<LineChart
  data={{
    values: [
      {
        value: -0.41765878,
        year: '1850'
      },
      {
        value: -0.2333498,
        year: '1851'
      },
      {
        value: -0.22939907,
        year: '1852'
      },
      {
        value: -0.27035445,
        year: '1853'
      },
      {
        value: -0.29163003,
        year: '1854'
      }
    ]
  }}
  xAxis="year"
  yAxis="value"
/>
```

We now have a README file ready to be published with DataHub Cloud!

### Optional steps
