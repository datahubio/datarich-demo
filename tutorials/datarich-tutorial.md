# Tutorial 1: Publish data-rich stories with DataHub

Hi, welcome to DataHub. In this tutorial, we are going to cover the basics of creating and publishing data-rich documents.

## Steps

### Create a GitHub repo

First, create a repo under your organisation or user in GitHub. DataHub currently does not support private repos, so make sure this new repo is public.

### Push a `README.md` file to the repo

Now, let's start with creating a `README.md` file. In this file, feel free to use anything that markdown has to offer. For this tutorial, we are going to use the following basic structure:

```markdown
# DataRich Tutorial

## Table

## Chart
```

### Add a table

Let's add a table to the `README.md` file. Under the `## Table` header in your file, add the following snippet:

```mdx
<FlatUiTable
  data={[
    {
      age: 35,
      firstName: "Jon",
      id: 1,
      lastName: "Snow",
    },
    {
      age: 42,
      firstName: "Cersei",
      id: 2,
      lastName: "Lannister",
    },
    {
      age: 45,
      firstName: "Jaime",
      id: 3,
      lastName: "Lannister",
    },
    {
      age: 16,
      firstName: "Arya",
      id: 4,
      lastName: "Stark",
    },
  ]}
/>
```

Here's what it's going to look like:

<FlatUiTable
  data={[
    {
      age: 35,
      firstName: 'Jon',
      id: 1,
      lastName: 'Snow'
    },
    {
      age: 42,
      firstName: 'Cersei',
      id: 2,
      lastName: 'Lannister'
    },
    {
      age: 45,
      firstName: 'Jaime',
      id: 3,
      lastName: 'Lannister'
    },
    {
      age: 16,
      firstName: 'Arya',
      id: 4,
      lastName: 'Stark'
    }
  ]}
 />

### Add a chart

Now, let's add a graph to the README file. To keep it simple, we are going to use the LineChart component in this tutorial. Add the following snippet to your README file under the `## Chart` header:

```mdx
<LineChart
  data={[
    [
      '1850',
      -0.41765878
    ],
    [
      '1851',
      -0.2333498
    ],
    [
      '1852',
      -0.22939907
    ],
    [
      '1853',
      -0.27035445
    ],
    [
      '1854',
      -0.29163003
    ]
  ]}
 />
```

This is what it will look like when rendered:

<LineChart
  data={[
    [
      '1850',
      -0.41765878
    ],
    [
      '1851',
      -0.2333498
    ],
    [
      '1852',
      -0.22939907
    ],
    [
      '1853',
      -0.27035445
    ],
    [
      '1854',
      -0.29163003
    ]
  ]}
 />

### Final document

At this point, your document should look like this:

```markdown
# DataRich Tutorial

## Table

<FlatUiTable
  data={[
    {
      age: 35,
      firstName: 'Jon',
      id: 1,
      lastName: 'Snow'
    },
    {
      age: 42,
      firstName: 'Cersei',
      id: 2,
      lastName: 'Lannister'
    },
    {
      age: 45,
      firstName: 'Jaime',
      id: 3,
      lastName: 'Lannister'
    },
    {
      age: 16,
      firstName: 'Arya',
      id: 4,
      lastName: 'Stark'
    }
  ]}
 />

## Chart

<LineChart
  data={[
    [
      '1850',
      -0.41765878
    ],
    [
      '1851',
      -0.2333498
    ],
    [
      '1852',
      -0.22939907
    ],
    [
      '1853',
      -0.27035445
    ],
    [
      '1854',
      -0.29163003
    ]
  ]}
 />
```

We now have a README file ready to be published with DataHub!
