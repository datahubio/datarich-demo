# Tutorial 1: Publish data-rich stories with DataHub

Hi, welcome to DataHub. In this tutorial, we are going to cover the basics of creating and publishing DataRich documents.

## Steps

### Create a GitHub repo

First, create a repo under your organisation or user in GitHub. DataHub currently does not support private repos, so make sure this new repo is public.

### Push a `README.md` file to the repo

Now, let's start with creating a `README.md` file. In this file, feel free to use anything that markdown has to offer. For this tutorial, we are going to use the following basic structure:

```markdown
# DataRich Tutorial

## Table

## Chart
```

### Add a table

Let's add a table to the `README.md` file. Under the `## Table` header in your file, add the following snippet:

```
<Table csv={`
Year,Cost
2018,50345.50
2019,65272.20
2020,48413.80
2021,76213.50
2022,71653.60
`} />
```

Here's what it's going to look like:

<Table csv={`
Year,Cost
2018,50345.50
2019,65272.20
2020,48413.80
2021,76213.50
2022,71653.60
`} />

### Add a chart

Now, let's add a graph to the README file. To keep it simple, we are going to use the LineChart component in this tutorial. Add the following snippet to your README file under the `## Chart` header:

```
<LineChart data={
    [
        ["2018",50345.50],
        ["2019",65272.20],
        ["2020",48413.80],
        ["2021",76213.50],
        ["2022",71653.60]
    ]
  }
  />
```

This is what it will look like when rendered:

<LineChart data={
    [
        ["2018",50345.50],
        ["2019",65272.20],
        ["2020",48413.80],
        ["2021",76213.50],
        ["2022",71653.60]
    ]
  }
/>

### Final document

At this point, your document should look like this:

```markdown
# DataRich Tutorial

## Table

<Table csv={`
Year,Cost
2018,50345.50
2019,65272.20
2020,48413.80
2021,76213.50
2022,71653.60
`} />

## Chart

<LineChart data={
    [
        ["2018",50345.50],
        ["2019",65272.20],
        ["2020",48413.80],
        ["2021",76213.50],
        ["2022",71653.60]
    ]
  }
/>

```

We now have a README file ready to be published with DataHub!

### Optional steps
